Git - version control system

Github - website (where we push/upload Git tracked code.)

Uses
    - easy to manage
    - easy to share platform
    - version management
    - collaboration of various developers

Repositories (repos)
    - Project folder which holds all files.
    - project folder which is being tracked by git.

    2 types of repos:

    1. Local - our PC local memory
    2. Remote - Github, GitLab

    whatever happens in our computer we can store in local repository and push it Remote repository later.

    Flow of Github:
    working directory -> staging area -> local repo -> remote repo
                     add             commit        push

    # working directory = is the place where you actively make changes to the code.

    # staging area = Temporary place where you put your files before putting/(committing it git) in local repo.

    # local repo = .git folder(hidden) which is being tracked. Once files reach this place it means changes are committed and tracked.

    # remote repo = Github here
